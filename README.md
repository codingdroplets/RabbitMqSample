In these videos we cover how to implement all RabbitMQ(Message Broker) operations in a C# Application - RabbitMQ C# [RabbitMQ .Net] Implementation.

RabbitMQ is a free, open-source and extensible message queuing solution. It is a message broker that understands AMQP Protocol (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol), but is also able to be used with other popular messaging solutions like MQTT. It is highly available, fault tolerant and scalable. It is implemented in Erlang OTP, a technology tailored for building stable, reliable, fault tolerant and highly scalable systems which possess native capabilities of handling very large numbers of concurrent operations.
